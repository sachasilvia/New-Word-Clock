# New-Word-Clock
This repository contains the new code for the Word Clock which gets time through WiFi instead of an RTC, as well as has the capabilities to be controlled through a Web Server. 

Install this library for NTPClient and WiFiUdp: https://github.com/taranais/NTPClient

Install this library for ESPAsyncWebServer: https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer

I used a SparkFun ESP32 Thing but any ESP32 will work.
